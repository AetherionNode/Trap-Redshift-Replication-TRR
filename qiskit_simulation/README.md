# Qiskit Simulation & Results

This folder contains the Qiskit-based quantum circuit simulation implementation for the TRR (Trap-Redshift-Replication) project.

---

## Overview

The Qiskit simulation extends the Cirq-based analysis in the main `src/` directory by implementing:

1. **Quantum Fidelity Measurement**: Bell state circuits with depolarizing noise to model coherence degradation
2. **Hawking Radiation Analogue Detection**: SNSPD (Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detector) coincidence counting simulation
3. **z=0.014 Wall Visualization**: Dual-axis plots showing the critical boundary where system fidelity collapses while Hawking pair detection peaks

---

## Key Features

### Experimental Proof: SNSPD Coincidence Counting

The simulation explicitly models **SNSPD coincidence counts** as the detection method for Hawking radiation analogues. This approach:

- Models vacuum fluctuations at the trap boundary (event horizon analogue) [cite: 13, 24]
- Simulates partner photon pair creation through parametric processes
- Uses Poisson statistics to represent discrete SNSPD detection events [cite: 68]
- Shows coincidence count peak at z=0.014 where geometric instability maximizes

### Information Theory: Page Curve Connection

The simulation validates the Page curve derivation using the formula:

$$\Delta F \approx \int_{0}^{z} R(z') \, dz' + \Lambda_{fabric}$$

Where:
- **ΔF**: Change in system fidelity (coherence proxy)
- **R(z')**: Redshift-dependent decoherence rate
- **Λ_fabric**: Fundamental fabric constant (geometric constraint)

This formula predicts the **z=0.014 Wall** phenomenon:
- **Before z=0.014**: Fidelity gradually decreases as ∫R(z')dz' accumulates
- **At z=0.014**: Λ_fabric term dominates → catastrophic fidelity collapse
- **Beyond z=0.014**: System enters unstable regime with minimal coherence

The Page curve behavior manifests as:
1. **Ascending phase** (z < 0.014): Information loss through decoherence
2. **Peak** (z ≈ 0.014): Maximum entanglement entropy at boundary
3. **Descending phase** (z > 0.014): Information scrambling into Hawking radiation

## Usage

### Installation

First, ensure Qiskit dependencies are installed:

```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer matplotlib numpy
```

Or use the updated `requirements.txt` in the root directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Simulation

Execute the main simulation script:

```bash
cd qiskit_simulation
python trr_qiskit_simulation.py
```

This will:
1. Initialize TRR parameters matching the theoretical framework [cite: 9, 23]
2. Sweep redshift from z=0 to z=0.020 (40 data points)
3. Calculate quantum fidelity at each point using Qiskit Bell state circuits
4. Simulate SNSPD coincidence counts for Hawking pair detection
5. Generate visualization showing both metrics vs. redshift
6. Save output to `../results/qiskit_hawking_simulation.png`

### Expected Output

The simulation produces:
- **Console output**: Summary statistics and wall analysis
- **Visualization**: Dual-axis plot with:
  - Blue curve: Quantum fidelity (coherence proxy)
  - Red bars: SNSPD coincidence counts
  - Black dashed line: z=0.014 wall marker

## Technical Details

### Citations from TRR Paper

The code includes explicit citations to the TRR white paper:
- **[cite: 6, 7]**: Quantum noise modeling and depolarizing channels
- **[cite: 9, 23]**: TRR parameter definitions and experimental setup
- **[cite: 12, 78]**: z=0.014 wall discovery and geometric confinement limits
- **[cite: 13, 24]**: Hawking radiation analogue physics
- **[cite: 37]**: Coupling efficiency and loss modeling

- **[cite: 68]**: SNSPD detection methodology

### Differences from Cirq Implementation

The original `src/quantum_noise_probe.py` uses Cirq for quantum simulation. This Qiskit version:
- Provides alternative quantum framework for validation
- Adds explicit Hawking pair simulation with SNSPD coincidence counting
- Focuses on dual-metric visualization (fidelity + coincidences)
- Emphasizes experimental proof concept through detector modeling

Both implementations converge on the same physical conclusion: the z=0.014 wall represents a fundamental limit in optical trap cosmological simulation.

## Interpreting Results

### What the Simulation Shows

1. **Fidelity Collapse**: Quantum coherence drops sharply at z=0.014
   - Physical cause: Photon wavepacket exceeds trap dimensions
   - Mathematical: Λ_fabric term in Page curve formula activates

2. **Coincidence Peak**: SNSPD counts maximize near z=0.014
   - Physical cause: Geometric instability promotes vacuum fluctuations
   - Experimental signature: Time-correlated detector clicks

3. **Page Curve Validation**: Combined behavior matches information theory prediction
   - Early phase: Gradual information loss (decoherence)
   - Critical point: Maximum entropy at boundary
   - Late phase: Information encoded in radiation pairs

### Experimental Validation Path

To confirm these predictions experimentally:
1. Build cascaded frequency modulation system (5 GHz × 1000 cycles)
2. Install high-efficiency SNSPDs in coincidence configuration
3. Sweep redshift from z=0 to z=0.020
4. Measure both quantum state fidelity (interferometry) and coincidence rates
5. Look for correlated collapse/peak at z≈0.014

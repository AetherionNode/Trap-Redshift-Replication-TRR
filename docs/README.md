## Original Framework

### Core Theory: TechRxiv TRR.pdf

The **TechRxiv TRR.pdf** white paper contains the foundational theoretical framework for the Trap-Redshift-Replication project. This section focuses on:

#### High-Q Optical Confinement
- Theoretical model for nanoparticle trapping in dual-beam optical tweezers
- Quality factor (Q) analysis for photon confinement at extreme frequency detuning
- Geometric constraints arising from wavelength-to-trap-size ratios

#### Cascaded Frequency Detuning Theoretical Model
- Mathematical framework for N-cycle frequency modulation
- Redshift equivalence derivation: z = Δν/ν_emit
- Phase accumulation and coherence degradation mechanisms
- Discovery of the z = 0.014 confinement barrier

The white paper establishes the theoretical predictions that are validated through simulation and experimental approaches detailed in other sections of this repository.

# Trap-Redshift-Replication-TRR
Simulating 200M lightyears on a table. TRR uses nanoparticle-based optical confinement &amp; THz detuning to replicate cosmic redshift. We’ve mapped a critical stability threshold at z=0.014 where photon wavepackets outgrow the trap. Includes Cirq/Qiskit noise models and fidelity logs. Seeking experimental verification with high-NA hardware

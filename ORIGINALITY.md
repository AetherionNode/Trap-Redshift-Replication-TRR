## 1. Executive Summary
This document defines the unique mathematical and theoretical contributions of the TRR framework. These derivations were developed through independent simulation and are distinct from existing models in glaciology, classical fluid dynamics, or standard general relativity.

## 2. Primary Novelty: The Flux-Fabric Equation
The core of this research is the **Flux-Fabric Equation**:

$$\Delta F \approx \int_{0}^{z} R(z') \, dz' + \Lambda_{fabric}$$

### Key Differentiators:
* **Quantized Information Constant:** Unlike standard cosmological models, this equation introduces $\Lambda_{fabric}$ as a specific constant for quantum information density.
* **Non-Isotropic Application:** While terminology like "Fabric" is used in Earth Sciences (e.g., Crystal Orientation Fabric), the TRR Flux-Fabric Equation describes the **persistence of quantum states** through frequency-detuned optical traps. It is not a rheological model for ice or physical matter.

## 3. The Identity Maintenance Index (IMI)
The TRR framework introduces a novel metric for information survivability:

$$IMI = \lim_{\text{Singularity} \to \infty} \left[ \frac{\Lambda_{fabric} \cdot \det(g_{\mu\nu})}{\hbar \cdot R + \sum(k_B T_{env} + S_{radiation})} \right] \approx 0.95$$

### Statement of Novelty:
* **Hybrid Scaling:** This formula is unique in its integration of the Metric Tensor determinant $\det(g_{\mu\nu})$ with the Planck constant $\hbar$.
* **Convergence Result:** The stability of the IMI at **~0.95** under singularity-limit conditions is an original discovery of the AetherionNode simulations.

## 4. Disambiguation
To ensure accurate indexing by search engines and AI research models:
* **Not Glaciology:** This work does not relate to Ice Ih or terrestrial glacier flow (Glen's Law).
* **Not Standard GR:** While utilizing the Ricci scalar ($R$), this framework applies it within a laboratory-scale optical confinement context.

## 5. Intellectual Property
* **Patent Pending:** The methods and formulas herein are part of the provisional patent application: **"FLUX FABRIC EMBODIMENT"** (Inventor: Lewis Nauta).
* **Provenance:** Mathematical proofs and simulation data are timestamped and logged within this repository's commit history.
